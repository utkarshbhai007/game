# FAQ

### What's the goal of this project?

To develop an open source implementation of [Little Big Adventure 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_Big_Adventure_2) that supports enhancements over the original game and modding.

Another goal is to make it easily accessible (cross-platform, can be played directly in a browser without any installation).

### Do I need the original LBA2 in order to use this project?

Yes, and no. At this point, you can directly play the [live demo](https://www.lba2remake.net/) thanks to Frederick Raynal kindly agreeing for us to share this link publicly as long as the game is still a work in progress.

When the game becomes fully playable we will have to take down that link and require that you own a legal copy in order to use this implementation.

Besides, if you plan on contributing, you will need to own the original game in order to obtain the game assets, since they are not part of this repository.

### Why use JavaScript?

* Rapid iteration. That helps a lot keeping motivated when youâ€™re doing this in your free time.
* Dynamic typing and live-reload help prototype things quickly. Understanding the original game engine involves a lot of trial and error.
* Decent support for a more declarative (vs imperative) coding style, which is good for code readability and maintenance.
* Makes the game easier to share, and automatically multi-platform, giving this old classic more visibility, and maybe a new public...

### Do you accept contributions?

Of course! Check the [contributing](../CONTRIBUTING.md) page for more information.
